-[1/2] At this time for reference, functions can return a variable 
  that has been allocated on the function stack, making this
  not possible, but only allowing it if the save was done via malloc

-[] Handle the Return issue in the parser, currently there
  is no mandatory presence, but this leads to llvm error problems

-[] Find a way to allow the declaration of a private variable
  within a class that is of the class's type

-[] At this moment I do not handle the fact that a pointer is nullptr,
  in that case it continues to access that memory that it had previously saved,
  and therefore obviously that memory no longer depends directly on it, causing problems
  But problably I need runtimeCheck

-[Done] If I have a statement like this: int x = p.getX();
  but in general if on the right I return a ptr,
  When I check if the result is of the same type,
  I do not check if it is a ptr or not,
  So a ptr will be saved on x instead of an i64

-[Done] Change every time I read ->isPointerTy() to my isPointer() function.
  This way I don't have problems with the subsequent development of pointers
